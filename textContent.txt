What is a module?
If you are a more advanced user feel free to skip this
section, however, if you don't really know what a
module is stick around.
  A module is generally understood as code that is stored in
 separate files which has a single functionality.
 You can then import this code and reuse it throughout a program.
 A library is a set of modules that share a common theme. In native
 Java Script, modules are not a prepackaged feature.
 The Node JS API documentation, which you can and should reference,
 can be a little overwhelming for someone who is brand new to programming
in Java Script.

//understand how require works
Just understand that you must first download a library and
then require('the library') you want to use. D3 is a library,
but it includes
//install d3
npm install d3
